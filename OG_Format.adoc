== Methodology

A working group on harmonization of the glider data format was set up in September 2020 at the request of the OceanGliders steering team. All members of the OceanGliders data management team were invited to join.
The three existing formats (at the time) were analysed and compared by the group. Regular technical meetings occurred and the format harmonization process was managed via a google doc. In late 2021 the group decided to move the document to https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual[GitHub] to better manage the issues, work asynchronously and contribute to the open source community.
The GitHub repository was open to any comments from the community and validation rules were created by the working group.
From there the working group organized regular meetings to validate the evolution of the format, discuss issues and finally reach a consensus on the OG1.0 format.

== Background

The OceanGliders program brings together marine scientists and glider operators from all over the world who observe the long-term physical, biogeochemical, biological ocean processes, and phenomena relevant for societal applications. It allows active coordination and strengthening the roles of gliders in the ocean observation programs worldwide and contributes to the present international efforts for ocean observation for climate, ocean health and real-time services.

The program oversees the monitoring of global glider activity, a prerequisite for active coordination. By sharing requirements, efforts and scientific knowledge needed for glider data collection OceanGliders aims to continuously develop the network by supporting the dissemination of glider data in global databases, in real-time and delayed mode, for a wider community.

The OceanGliders program was created about 10 years after the popularization of the use of gliders by ocean scientists. With no common rules on format, data managers from Australia, the USA, and Europe processed 3 regional formats that are not interoperable.

Harmonization toward interoperability within the existing formats and many national/regional glider networks is a recommendation from the OceanGliders steering team to strengthen the program and reach the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) adopted by GOOS (Global Ocean Observing System), and better monitor the program activity.

== Objectives

This document defines the common OceanGliders data format, hereafter OG1.0.

////
* [[og1.0-general-conventions]]
= OG1.0 General conventions
////
== OG1.0 General conventions

* The required granularity of the data set is the glider mission, starting from deployment at sea to recovery.

* Data are recorded as a trajectory Discrete Geometry, using NetCDFfootnote:[NetCDF-3 does not satisfy the requirements of OG1.0 format] system and following CF 1.8footnote:[http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#trajectory-data] (Climate and Forecast) specifications. Each data file contains a series of dive cycles representing the mission of the glider. It can be produced in near real time after every glider transmission and revised later into a recovery-mode (when glider on shore and any data gaps filled in) or a delayed-mode (after rigorous QC) version.
* Format follows the ACDD 1.3 convention.
* Variables are identified in capital letters.
* Attributes are identified in lower case.
* Vocabulary collections will be hosted in different places (NERC Vocabulary Server - NVS, OceanOPS, ICES, etc). The OceanGliders data management team will manage (additions, updates, etc.) the collections.
* OG1.0 oversees the following parameters: CTD measurements, Oxygen measurements, Optical fluorescence, and backscatter measurements. Other types of measurements (intermediate parameters, technical measurements, and other variables) not framed by OG1.0 could be included in OG1.0 data files. No control will be applied to those measurements.
* GPS variables and along-track positioning variables are mandatory.
* Interpolation methodologies used to compute along-track positioning variables, phases and QC needs publishing as a best practice document under strict rules.
* A list of mandatory metadata describing the data set is defined below.
* It is highly encouraged to use a unique resource identifier (uri) to increase machine-to-machine communications.
* 3 recommendations level have been defined for attributes:

  - Mandatory: Minimum metadata set to be compliant with OG1.0 requirement.
	- Highly desirable: Worth having for complete use of the data set.
	- Suggested: If the information is available.

== DOI management

* DOI can be minted at any level (PI, Reference Data Center, Data Assembly Center, Global Data Assembly Center) following the internal policy of data curation.
* DOI can be minted for a single glider mission or multiple glider missions (i.e. project, reference lines).
* DOI if included in OG1.0 files needs to be preserved. The DOI must remain unchanged if there is no valuable modification. If valuable information is aggregated/added or a new product produced, a new DOI shall be created and the new DOI MUST link to the original DOI to acknowledge as the source
* GDACs will create an evolving global data set with a DOI referring to all existing DOIs.
* The most effective way of preserving the integrity of the source citation is to preserve the intitial DOI added in the OG1.0 file.


////
* [[og1.0-file-naming-convention]]

== OG1.0 file naming convention

* Data files should be named as follows:

* Recalling that:
	- "id" : "<trajectory>_<data_mode>" (ex : "sp065_20210616T1430_R")
	- "trajectory" : "<platform_name>_<start_date>" (ex :  "sp065_20210616T1430")

Note 1: For a simple case, PHASE calculation is relatively easy. But in some cases, PHASE calculation remains difficult. When code will be available publicly and described in some published best practices, PHASE will become mandatory. Note 2: Quality control of the PHASE could be useful to manage difficult cases.

Note 3: PHASE is used to derive data product (profile, trajectory profiles, gridded product) from OG1.0 data sets. It is recommended to include PHASE when possible.

== Sensor information

A sensor is a device used to measure a physical parameter. Sensor outputs are provided in parameter counts and need to be converted into parameter physical units using a calibration equation. This conversion can be done onboard the float or during the decoding process.

This section contains information about the sensors of the glider. Each ocean state variable to be recorded must be described with its sensor. Gears with multiple sensors (i.e. CTD) should consider separated sensors in particular if there is not a unique serial number and calibration date for the sensors.

For each sensor it is created a group with the following group attributes:

A parameter is a measurement of a physical phenomenon; it can be provided by a sensor (in sensor counts or in physical units) or computed (derived) from other parameters. A sensor can measure 1 to N parameter(s). A parameter can be measured by 1 or N sensor(s).

This section contains information about the parameters measured by the glider or derived from glider measurements. The section is based on the approach used in

Note: It is anticipated to upgrade the ancillary variable related to QC by refining the ancillary variable name like < PARAM >_qc_generic, < PARAM >_qc_spike_test, <PARAM>_qc_land_test, etc. Current _QC attributes based on CF guidance (https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#flags)
and use the GOOS networks 0-4 flagging convention.

_Notes:_

* Units are a special case to be discussed because the convention in GOOS is UD units which are a conflation of observed property and measurement scale. UD units are available in spreadsheet form but not on a vocabulary server. Efforts are ongoing in the internal community to harmonize a common unit's vocabulary.
* A sustainable model to resource the development and ongoing maintenance of vocabularies will need to be identified during the implementation phase of the OG1.0.

Vocabularies will be fully defined during the implementation phase of the OG1.0. The current version of the vocabulary collections is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dN90xkw9oCbLs0sPPhOmszdOjLpwcqxiK5mjeZP7abA/edit?usp=sharing[_Interim Reference Document_]

== Best practices

Methodologies used to produce files meeting the OG format should be published in the IODE Ocean Best Practice (OBP) repository (https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/[_https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/_]) under the community “OceanGliders” and the collection “data management”. The following methodologies are covered, among others:

* Interpolation
* PHASE computation
* RTQC 

Methodologies should describe the computation methods used (typically by Data Assembly Centers) to produce the data set. Ocean Best Practices are assigned a DOI and should be tagged as "OceanGliders" practices by the submitter. Additionally, OBP endorsed by the OceanGliders data management task team will be marked as such.
