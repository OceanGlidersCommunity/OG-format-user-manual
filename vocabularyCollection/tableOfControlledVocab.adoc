== Vocabulary Collections
Series of concept of the https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG1.0-user-manual[OG1.0 format] are controlled by a collection of vocabularies managed by the OceanGliders data management team and other governance boddy. +
These concepts are listed in the table below. Each concept is linked to its collection of vocabularies. Each element of the collection has a status attribute. +
[square]
* The *validated* entries have been validated by the vocabulary working group and can be used in the OG1.0 format. +
* The *published* entries have been published by the host when it exist. +
* The *pending* entries are being discussed by the community and are not yet supported by the OG1.0 format. +

Vocabularies that are not governed by OceanGliders do not follow the *status* convention described above.

=== Host and governance of vocabulary collection

**Host** : The host is the entity that is serving the *published* vocabularies. A collection served by host enable the machine to machine communication.
**Governance** :  Governance refers to the entity in charge of the maintenance, evolution and publication of the vocabulary collection.

=== Request a new entry

To request a new entry in any of the collection listed below, you should submit an issue to this repository entitle _"new entry for table_ `*<name of the vocabulary>*` _"_. 
The issue must indicate the value of the new entry and all its relevant attributes described in the corresponding table.
                                                                                        
=== Validation process
  
A working group on controlled vocabulary will review the requests for new vocabularies regularly.
While a continuous update of the controlled vocabularies is anticipated, the working group will update a new version of controlled vocabulary at least twice a year.
The aim is to update the collection on the host server at least once a year.

=== Non synchronised list
It is expected that the vocabulary collections will not always been synchronized between this repository and the NVS services. There will be a lag between validating a entry here and this entry being published in NVS. This lag is due to different governance and validation rules between governance and host. +
`*The reference lists are the lists available below.*`
