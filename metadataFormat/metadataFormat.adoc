* [[Metadata format]]
////
= General information
The metadata format of OceanGliders (here after OG1.0.json) should be deliver by DACs along with OceanGliders trajectory files.
OG1.0.json metadata file contains descriptive information about an glider mission.

= File naming convention
OG1.0.json follow the file naming convention of the OG1.0.nc trajectory files. Metadata files should be named as follows:

	- "<id>.json" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025.json")

Where <id> = "<platform_serial>_<start_date>" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025.json")

= File header
"0G_metadata_format_version": "1.0",

= Global attribute
The following attributes should appear in the global attribute section of the OG1.O.json.

[%"header",cols="1,3,1,2a"]
