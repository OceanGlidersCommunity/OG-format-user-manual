[#anchor-1]####Overview

Control vocabularies contribute to standardizing the information
provided by the glider community in the OG1.0 format. It is part of the
data management strategy to implement the FAIR principles.

The following element of OG1.0 falls under control vocabulary procedure.
The aim is to manage the content of key elements of the format (variable
and attribute), to build interoperability within the data providers and
across networks. It is also required to implement part of the FAIR
principles.

Each element of each collection listed below are agreed by the
OceanGliders data management team. It is associated with a “short_name”,
a “long_name”, a definition, and an uri (unique resource identifier).
Host and manager of each collection is identified in the table below.

[#anchor-2]####Management of the evolution of OG1.0 controlled
vocabularies.

The data management board of OceanGliders will maintain its reference
table autonomously. BODC will complement OG1.0 vocabulary and map it to
master lists that cover more than the network's needs.

|SDN:B76::B7600002 |Kongsberg Maritime Seaglider M1 glider |An
autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on buoyancy. It was developed
for continuous, long-term measurement of oceanographic parameters. It
uses small changes in buoyancy and wings to achieve forward motion. The
system's pitch and roll are controlled using adjustable ballast (the
vehicle battery). The vehicle moves through the water in a saw-tooth
like pattern and surfaces often to determine its position. Navigation is
accomplished using a combination of GPS fixes while on the surface and
internal sensors that monitor the vehicle heading, depth and attitude
during dives. External sensors are constantly scanning the ocean to
determine environmental properties. The glider is 1.8 - 2 m long with a
maximum diameter of 30 cm and antenna mast length between 43 cm and 1 m.
It weighs 52 kg with a wing span of 1 m. It has a deployment range of
4600 km, deployment length of 10 months and an operating depth range
between 50-1000 m. Maximum speed is 25 cm/s.

|SDN:B76::B7600013 |Teledyne Webb Research Slocum G1 glider |A
long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on buoyancy. It is
used for remote water column sampling. It uses hydraulic buoyancy change
to alter the vehicle density in relation to the surrounding water
thereby causing the vehicle to either float or sink. Given an
appropriate dive or climb angle, the wings and body lift and convert
some of this vertical motion into a forward saw tooth horizontal motion.
Periodically, the glider surfaces and calls via Iridium Satellite Phone
(anywhere in world) or Free Wave RF Modem (line of sight) in to
Dockserver (auto attendant computer) to relay navigational fix, data and
receive further instructions for command and control. The glider is
capable of storm sampling and can be flown in a coordinated fleet. It is
1.5 m in length, has a hull diameter of 22 cm and mass of 54 kgs. It has
an exchangeable payload (capacity up to 6 L) which is capable of housing
a variety of environmental sensors such as nitrate and oxygen. It uses
lithium or alkaline batteries. It has a deployment range of 600-6000 km,
a deployment length of 15 days to 12 months and an operating depth range
of 4-1000m. Navigation is via GPS waypoints, a pressure and altimeter
sensor. Maximum speed is .35 m/s. It transmits via RF modem, Iridium
(RUDICS), ARGOS or acoustic modem.

(dependent upon configuration). It has an exchangeable payload (capacity
up to 6 L) which is capable of housing a variety of environmental

batteries. It has a deployment range of 350-13000 km (dependent upon
configuration), a deployment length of 15 days to 18 months (dependent
upon configuration) and an operating depth range of 4-1000m. Navigation
is via GPS waypoints, a pressure and altimeter sensor. Maximum speed is
0.35 m/s (0.68 knot) with the buoyancy engine and an average up to 0.5
m/s (1 knots) with full drive, with the thruster: Up to 1 m/s (2 knots).
It transmits via RF modem, Iridium (RUDICS), ARGOS or acoustic modem.

_Example_: (taken from “L22/SeaVox” vocabulary):

· Aanderaa 4831 oxygen Optode, A dissolved oxygen sensor which provides
analogue (0-5V) and digital output (RS-232) to third party data loggers,
gliders and floats. Measurement based on the ability of selected
substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers. The fluorescent
indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas
permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. In this
standard model, a black optical isolation coating protects the complex
from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water. This sensing foil
is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring
system from inside a watertight housing. The foil is excited by
modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured.
For improved stability the 4831 optode also performs a reference phase
reading by use of a red LED that does not produce fluorescence in the
foil. This model is fitted with a standard sensing foil. By linearizing
and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor,
the absolute O2 concentration can be determined. Accuracy +/- 1.5% or
2uM; precision +/- 0.2 uM.

and OG1 ? Maybe the list needs to be reviewed.
