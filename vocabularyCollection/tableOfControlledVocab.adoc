== Vocabulary Collections
Series of concept of the https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG1.0-user-manual[OG1.0 format] are controlled by a collection of vocabularies managed be the OceanGliders data management team.
These concept are listed below. Each concept is linked to its collection of vocabularies. The *published* entries have been agreed by the OceanGliders community and can be used in the OG1.0 format. The *pending* entries are being discussed by the community and are not yet supported by the OG1.0 format.
Note that some of the publised collection are available in the https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/[Nerc Vocabulary Server]. 
Here we recall that having the collection served by NVS will allow machine to machine communication capacity.

=== Request a new entry

To request a new entry in any of the collection, you should submit an issue entitle _"new entry for table_ `*<name of the vocabulary>*` _"_. 
The issue must indicate the value of the new entry and all its relevant attributes described in the table.
                                                                                        
=== Validation process
  
A working group on controlled vocabulary will reviewing the requests for new vocabularies regularly.
While a continuous update of the controlled vocabularie is anticipated, the working group will publish an updated version of controlled vocabulary at least twice a year. 
The update on the NVS server will occure at least once a year.

=== Non synchronised list
It is expected that the vocabulary collections will not always been synchronized between this repository and the NVS services. There will be a lag between validating a entry here and this entry being published in NVS. This lag is due to different governance and validation rules between OceanGliders and NVS.
*The reference lists are the list available below.*
