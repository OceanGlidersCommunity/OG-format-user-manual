== Vocabulary Collections
The series of concepts of the https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG1.0-user-manual[OG1.0 format] are controlled by a set of vocabulary collections managed by the OceanGliders data management team and other governance bodies. +
These concepts are listed in the table below. Each concept is linked to its collection of vocabularies. Each collection has a status attribute. +
[square]
* The *validated* entries have been validated by the vocabulary working group and can be used in the OG1.0 format. +
* The *published* entries have been published by the host when it exists. +
* The *pending* entries are being discussed by the community and are not yet supported by the OG1.0 format. +

Vocabulary collections that are not governed by OceanGliders do not follow the *status* convention described above.

=== "host" and "governance" of the vocabulary collection

**host** : The host is the entity that is serving the *published* vocabulary collections and enable machine to machine communication. +
**governance** :  Governance refers to the entity in charge of the maintenance, evolution and publication of the vocabulary collection.

=== Request a new entry
**TO BE UPDATED WITH EMMA and NVS TEAM**
To request a new entry in the table below, one should submit an issue to this repository entitle `*_new entry for table <name of the vocabulary>_*` . 
The issue must indicate the value of the new entry and all its relevant attributes described in the corresponding table.
                                                                                        
=== Validation process
  
A working group on controlled vocabulary collections will review the requests regularly.
While a continuous update of the controlled vocabularies is anticipated, the working group will update the vocabulary collection at least twice a year.

`*The reference lists are the lists available below.*`
