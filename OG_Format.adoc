== Methodology

A working group on harmonization of the glider data format was set up in September 2020 at the request of the OceanGliders steering team. All members of the OceanGliders data management team were invited to join.
The three existing formats (at the time) were analysed and compared by the group. Regular technical meetings occurred and the format harmonization process was managed via a Google doc. In late 2021 the group decided to move the document to https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual[GitHub] to better manage the issues, work asynchronously and contribute to the open source community.
The GitHub repository is open to any comments from the community and validation rules were created by the working group (see the https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual/blob/main/governance.md[governance document]).
From there the working group organized regular meetings to validate the evolution of the format, discuss issues and reach a consensus on the OG1.0 format. It is envisaged that the format will continually evolve with contributions from the community.

== Background

The https://www.oceangliders.org/[OceanGliders] program brings together marine scientists and glider operators from all over the world who observe the long-term physical, biogeochemical, biological ocean processes, and phenomena relevant for societal applications. It allows active coordination and strengthening the roles of gliders in the ocean observation programs worldwide and contributes to the present international efforts for ocean observation for climate, ocean health and real-time services.

The program oversees the monitoring of global glider activity, a prerequisite for active coordination. By sharing requirements, efforts and scientific knowledge needed for glider data collection OceanGliders aims to continuously develop the network by supporting the dissemination of glider data in global databases, in real-time and delayed mode, for a wider community.

The OceanGliders program was created about 10 years after the popularization of the use of gliders by ocean scientists. With no common rules on format, data managers from Australia (https://imos.org.au/[IMOS]), the USA (https://gliders.ioos.us/[IOOS]), and Europe (https://www.coriolis.eu.org/[Coriolis]) processed 3 regional formats that are not interoperable.

Harmonization toward interoperability within the existing formats and many national/regional glider networks is a recommendation from the OceanGliders steering team to strengthen the program and reach the https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/[FAIR principles] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) adopted by https://goosocean.org/[GOOS] (Global Ocean Observing System), and better monitor the program activity.

== Objectives

This document defines the common OceanGliders data format, hereafter OG1.0.

////
* [[og1.0-general-conventions]]
= OG1.0 General conventions
////
== OG1.0 General conventions

* The required granularity of the data set is the glider mission, starting from deployment at sea to recovery.
* Data are recorded as a trajectory Discrete Geometry, using NetCDFfootnote:[NetCDF-3 does not satisfy the requirements of OG1.0 format] system and following CF 1.10footnote:[http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html] (Climate and Forecast) specifications. Each data file contains a series of dive cycles representing the mission of the glider. It can be produced in near real time after every glider transmission and revised later into a recovery-mode (when glider on shore and any data gaps filled in) or a delayed-mode (after rigorous QC) version.
* Format follows the ACDD 1.3footnote:[https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3] convention where possible.
* Vocabulary collections will be hosted in different places (NERC Vocabulary Server - NVS, OceanOPS, ICES, etc). The OceanGliders data management team will manage (additions, updates, etc.) the collections. Treatment of vocabularies is detailed in the https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/OG-format-user-manual/vocabularyCollection/tableOfControlledVocab.html[vocabularies document].
* OG1.0 defines some variables and definitions, as described in this document. Other types of measurements (e.g. intermediate parameters, technical measurements, other variables) not framed by OG1.0 can be included in OG1.0 data files. No control will be applied to those measurements.
* Geospatial variables and along-track positioning variables are mandatory.
* Methodologies used to interpolate data, compute along-track positioning variables, apply QC etc. Should be linked and, where possible, follow community best practices. It is encouraged to use unique resource identifiers (uris) to link to these resources.
* 3 recommendations level have been defined for OG1.0:

  - Mandatory: Minimum metadata set to be compliant with OG1.0 requirement.
  - Highly desirable: Worth having for complete use of the data set.
  - Suggested: If the information is available.

== DOI management

* A DOI can be minted at any level (PI, Reference Data Center, Data Assembly Center, Global Data Assembly Center) following the internal policy of data curation.
* A DOI can be minted for a single glider mission or multiple glider missions (i.e. project, reference lines).
* A DOI if included in OG1.0 files needs to be preserved. The DOI must remain unchanged if there is no valuable modification. If valuable information is aggregated/added or a new product produced, a new DOI should be created and the new DOI should link to the original DOI to acknowledge as the source
* The most effective way of preserving the integrity of the source citation is to preserve the initial DOI added in the OG1.0 file.


////
* [[og1.0-file-naming-convention]]
= OG1.0 file naming convention
////
== OG1.0 file naming convention

* Data files should be named as follows:

	- "<id>.nc" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025_R.nc")

Where <id> = "<platform_serial>_<start_date>_<data_mode>" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025_R")

In this case:

	- <platform_serial> = "sp065" a Spray glider number 065
    - <start_date> =  "20210616T143025" The datetime in seconds precision 2021-06-16 14:30:25 formatted following ISO 8601
    - <data_mode> = "R" for near real time data

== Global attributes

The global attribute section is used for data discovery. The following global attributes should appear in the global section. The NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions are available from: http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html#trajectory-data[_http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html#trajectory-data_].

PHASE describes the glider behaviors when at sea. The different behaviors are described in the phase vocabulary (ascent, descent, surfacing, parking, inflection, etc.)

Note that the vocabulary will be fully described and implemented in the control vocabulary tool during the implementation phase.

Phase calculation methodologies need publishing as a best practice document separately to the OG1.0 terms of reference.

The tables below describe the mandatory information to PHASE stored in two ways.

////
== Sensor information

Each geophysical variable to be recorded must be described with its sensor. Sensor information are stored in an empty and dimensionless variable filled with variable attributes.

=== Naming convention of the sensor variables

Sensor variables are named as follows: *SENSOR_<sensor_type>_<sensor_serial_number>*

Where <sensor_type> is a controlled vocabulary: see vocabulary guidelines

== Geophysical variables

Geophysical variables are measurements of a physical phenomenon (or an intermediate variable needed to measure a physical phenomenon); It is provided directly by a sensor (in sensor counts or in physical units) or computed (derived) from other parameters (i.e. intermediate parameters).

The fill value should have the same data type as the variable and be outside the range of possible data values.

== Best practices

Methodologies used to produce files meeting the OG format should be published in the IODE Ocean Best Practice (OBP) repository (https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/[_https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/_]) under the community “OceanGliders” and the collection “data management”. The following methodologies are covered, among others:

* Interpolation
* PHASE computation
* RTQC 

Methodologies should describe the computation methods used (typically by Data Assembly Centers) to produce the data set. Ocean Best Practices are assigned a DOI and should be tagged as "OceanGliders" practices by the submitter. Additionally, OBP endorsed by the OceanGliders data management task team will be marked as such.
