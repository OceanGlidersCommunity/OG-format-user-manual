* [[Guidelines for controlled vocabularies]]
////
== Controlled vocabulary
A controlled vocabulary is a curated list of terms that have been pre-defined and approved for use within a specific context, such as data management. This type of vocabulary serves as a standardized set of terms used to monitor content consistently, ensuring uniformity, precision and analysis.

== Use controlled vocabulary
Each OG1.0 controlled vocabulary (list of terms) is referenced in this document. 
To find the appropriate term, click on the link to the list and find the term that suits your needs. 

Each attribute or variable controlled by a vocabulary is associated with a attribute called **_vocabulary* in the format. This attribute refers to the uri of the term.

For instance global attribute *platform* is a controlled vocabulary. In the format description it is followed by the global attribute *platform_vocabulary*. 

In this case:

* platform = "sub-surface gliders" ;
* platform_vocabulary = "https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L06/current/27/" ;

== Vocabulary Collections
The series of concepts of the https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG1.0-user-manual[OG1.0 format] are controlled by a set of vocabulary collections managed by the OceanGliders data management team and other governance bodies. +
These concepts are listed in the table below. Each concept is linked to its collection of vocabularies. Each collection has a status attribute. +
[square]
* The *pending* entries are being discussed by the community and are not yet supported by the OG1.0 format. +
* The *validated* entries have been validated by the vocabulary working group and can be used in the OG1.0 format. +
* The *published* entries have been published by the host when it exists. +

Vocabulary collections that are not governed by OceanGliders do not follow the *status* convention described above.

=== "host" and "governance" of the vocabulary collection

**host** : The host is the entity that is serving the *published* vocabulary collections and enable machine to machine communication. +
**governance** :  Governance refers to the entity in charge of the maintenance, evolution and publication of the vocabulary collection.

=== Requesting a new term
To request a new term for an existing vocabularly collection please create an new issue in the OceanGliders repository including the label 'vocab'.

New terms may also be requested via the 'Request new term' URLs in the table below. Please clearly indicate in the ticket 'for approval by OceanGliders vocabularly working group' and include as much detail as possible. 

=== Requesting a new collection
If you are unsure where a new term fits and believe a new collection is needed, please create an issue in the OceanGliders repository clearly including the title 'vocab'. 

                                                                                        
=== Validation process
  
A working group for controlled vocabulary collections will review the requests regularly to approve new terms. Simple terms adding to existing collections will have a quick turnaround. 
Requests for new vocabularly collections will take longer to review and approve.
