| 0 | unknown | when the platform phases described below do not fit the platform behavior, or when the behavior of the platform is unknown | pending |
| 1 | ascent | the platform is commanded to move upward - climbing | pending |
| 2 | descent | the platform is commanded to move downward - diving | pending |
| 3 | surfacing | the platform is performing a surfacing maneuver or is at the surface for communication, recovery or safety purpose | pending |
| 4 | parking | the platform is maintained at a parking or hover depth, not moving relative to the water | pending |
| 5 | inflection | the platform is below the surface and is changing from ascent to descent or descent to ascent | pending |
| 6 | propelled | the platform is moving laterally, parallel to the water surface, using propellers/thrusters| pending |
| 7 | transition | the platform is changing from one of the defined phases to another defined phase | pending |
