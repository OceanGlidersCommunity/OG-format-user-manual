* [[Metadata format]]
////
= General information
The metadata format of OceanGliders (here after OG1.0.json) should be deliver by DACs along with OceanGliders trajectory files.
OG1.0.json metadata file contains descriptive information about an glider mission.
OG1.0.json defines some metadata and definitions (align with OG1.O ToR), as described in this document. Other types of metadata not framed by OG1.0.json can be included in OG1.0.josn metadata files. No control will be applied to those measurements.

= File naming convention
OG1.0.json follow the file naming convention of the OG1.0.nc trajectory files. Metadata files should be named as follows:

	- "<id>.json" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025.json")

Where <id> = "<platform_serial>_<start_date>" (ex : "sp065_20210616T143025.json")

= File header
"0G_metadata_format_version": "1.0",

= Global attribute
The following attributes should appear in the global attribute section of the OG1.O.json.
