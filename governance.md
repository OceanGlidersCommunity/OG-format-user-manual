# OceanGliders format governance

## Status
Draft policy based on the existing README for review and feedback from the OceanGliders Data Management Task Team (OGDMTT) and OceanGliders (OG) Steering Team, dated June 27, 2022."

## Data format

### Who is reviewing the issues?
A sub-group of the OceanGliders data management team (OGDMTT format governance subgroup) will be in charge of reviewing the issues.

### How to present an issue?
Please provide a detailed explanation of the issue along with an example. Feel free to include any suggestions related to the issue.

### How do we proceed with an issue?
The format will need to grow and evolve over time while being effectively managed by the OGDMTT.

The team will formally analyze each issue. If the issue lacks sufficient detail or lacks an associated example, it will be rejected. If the issue is accepted for review, the team will study it and provide a response. This analysis may lead to a modification of the format. If consensus cannot be reached on a solution, the proposed solution will be rejected, and the format will remain unchanged. However, a new branch can be created to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed solution. The same issue can be resubmitted along with a demonstration.

If a format update is deemed necessary, a pull request will be made from the repository, and updates will be applied to the format description and supporting tools such as format checkers. The draft changes will be shared with OGDMTT members within the GitHub repository for approval. Stakeholders will be notified of the change at this stage.

## How will an accepted issue impact the OG format or vocabulary collections?
Any accepted issue will be incorporated into future versions of the OG format and vocabulary collections. The format will be released annually, with each release scheduled for January. Issues accepted in September will be implemented in the upcoming format release.

## Engagement with the OceanGliders GitHub repository
GitHub enables users to engage with the repository continuously, facilitating the progression of the format. Since most community members are not resourced to work full-time on the format, much of the activity is voluntary. Therefore, the community encourages users to engage with relevant issues approximately once every two weeks. When there is a critical mass of issues and pull requests to be discussed, a meeting of the OGDMTT will be convened to progress these more efficiently, with the outcomes of discussions documented in the GitHub repository.
