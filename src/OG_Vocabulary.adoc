[#anchor-1]####Overview

Control vocabularies contribute to standardizing the information
provided by the glider community in the OG1.0 format. It is part of the
data management strategy to implement the FAIR principles.

The following element of OG1.0 falls under the control vocabulary procedure.
The aim is to manage the content of key elements of the format (variable
and attribute), to build interoperability within the data providers and
across networks. It is also required to implement part of the FAIR
principles.

Each element of each collection listed below is agreed by the
OceanGliders data management team. It is associated with a “short_name”,
a “long_name”, a definition, and an uri (unique resource identifier).
The host and manager of each collection are identified in the table below.

[#anchor-2]####Management of the evolution of OG1.0 controlled
vocabularies.

The data management board of OceanGliders will maintain its reference
table autonomously. BODC will complement OG1.0 vocabulary and map it to
master lists that cover more than the network's needs.
